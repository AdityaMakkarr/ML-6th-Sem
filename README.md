**Dataset Analysis and Model Performance Report**

### Introduction
The dataset used for this analysis is the Adult Census Income dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains demographic and employment-related information from the U.S. Census Bureau and is commonly used for income prediction. The target variable is binary, indicating whether an individual earns more than $50K per year. Attributes include age, education, marital status, occupation, relationship, race, sex, hours worked per week, and native country. The goal was to explore various machine learning models to predict income levels accurately.

### Model Implementation and Performance
Several machine learning models were implemented, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), K-Means Clustering, Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and a Multi-Layer Neural Network. Given the dataset’s mix of categorical and numerical variables, Logistic Regression and KNN were particularly suitable.

Logistic Regression provided the highest accuracy, as it handles binary classification well and works effectively with properly encoded categorical data. KNN also performed well, likely due to distinguishable income patterns in relation to education and occupation. K-Means Clustering was less effective due to the dataset’s non-linear relationships. Decision Tree and Naïve Bayes provided reasonable accuracy but were outperformed by Logistic Regression.

### Conclusion
This project provided valuable insights into model selection based on dataset characteristics. Understanding data structure and distribution played a key role in improving model performance. This experience reinforced the importance of data in machine learning and its impact on real-world predictions, deepening my appreciation for preprocessing, model selection, and performance evaluation.
